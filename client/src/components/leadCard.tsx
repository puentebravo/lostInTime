          Oh, king eh? Very nice. And how'd you get that, eh? By exploiting the
          workers. By hanging on to outdated imperialist dogma which perpetuates
          the economic and social differences in our society. Manacles! Ooooh,
          my idea of heaven, is to be allowed to be put in manacles. Just for a
          few hours. They must think the sun shines out your ass, sonny. Shut
          your festering gob, you tit! Your type really makes me puke you
          vacuous, toffy-nosed, malodorous pervert! Is your wife a goer, eh?
          Know what I mean? Know what I mean? Nudge, nudge! Know what I mean?
          Say no more! Get on with it! Come and see the violence inherent in the
          system. Help! Help! I'm being repressed! All right, but apart from the
          sanitation, medicine, education, wine, public order, irrigation,
          roads, the fresh water system and public health, what have the Romans
          ever done for us? I cut down trees, I skip and jump, I like to press
          wildflowers. I put own womens' clothing, and hang around in bars.
